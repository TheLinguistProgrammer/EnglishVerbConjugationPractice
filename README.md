The aim of this application is to provide a simple way for students of the English language to practice conjugating verbs in different tenses. The functionality includes:
- selecting from 7 different tenses
- negative sentences
- grammar explanation upon clicking on the tense
- translation upon clicking on the verb (Turkish and Chinese using Google Translate)

The python scripts facilitated changing the data, along with google sheets for the translations.
This project took 6 days (September)
