The aim of this application is to provide a simple way for students of the English language to practice conjugating verbs in different tenses. The functionality includes:
- selecting from 7 different tenses
- negative sentences
- grammar explanation upon clicking on the tense
- translation upon clicking on the verb (Turkish and Chinese using Google Translate)

The original datasets were modified for this project (JCEFR dataset and 1000 English verbs) using Python and Google sheets (translations)
This project took 6 days (September)
